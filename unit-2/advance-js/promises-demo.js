// 2. difficult to debug
// 3. difficult to handle errors
// 4. difficult to manage multiple asynchronous operations

// Examples of callback hell 

// Imagine fetching user data, then fetching posts of that user, then comments of the first post:

getUser(1, (user) => {
  getPosts(user.id, (posts) => {
    getComments(posts[0].id, (comments) => {

//   { id: 2, postId: 1, content: 'Very informative.' } ]

/*ðŸ‘‰ Problem:

Code is nested like a pyramid.

Hard to add error handling â€” every level needs its own if (err).

Hard to reuse parts.

  Getting Email from Server - I
Description
You are required to get the email of the currently logged-in user from the server. 
In order to mock the functionality of getting it from the server, you can use the setTimeout() method and 
assume that the email will be returned as a response after 2 seconds.

Implement this using a promise and in the producing code, 
resolve the promise while sending in the received email as the argument to the resolve callback.

Initially, the message should be printed as 'Getting email from server...' to the console.

/*

You  are required to create a promise object which has the producer code that uploads an image to the server.
Notice that you do not have to actucally upload an image to the server, rather, you just need to mock the functionality. You can use the setTimeout() method
for this purpose and set the timer for, let's say, 4 seconds.

Also, define the consumer methods by using bothe the approaches that we have discussed - using then() method having two callbacks and using a then() method have a single callback and then having a catch().
